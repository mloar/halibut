\C{chap} First chapter title

This is a paragraph of text. It
has line breaks in   between words, multiple   
  spaces (ignored), and \e{emphasised text} as well as \c{code
fragments}.

\cw{This} is weak code. And \k{head} contains some other stuff.
\K{subhead} does too.

\H{head} First section title

Here's a code paragraph:

\c No leading spaces
\c  One leading space
\c Two blank lines follow this one.
\c
\c
\c Two blank lines precede this one.
\c   Two leading spaces
\c We can use \ { and } with impunity here.

This is a list:

\b Ooh.

\b Aah.

\b Eek.

This is a numbered list:

\n Ooh.

\n{keyword} Aah.

\n Eek. `Aah' is point \k{keyword}.

Oh, while I'm here: some special characters. The \\, \{ and \}
characters, to be precise. And their code equivalents, \c{\\},
\i\c{\{}, \c{\}}.

\S{subhead} First subheading

So here's a \I{subheading}\I{subsection}subsection. Just
incidentally, `this' is in quotes. \ii{Those} quotes had better work
in all formats.

We'll try for some Unicode here: \i{Schr\u00F6{oe}dinger}.

An index tag containing non-alternatived Unicode: \i{\u00BFChe?}

An invisible index tag: \I{she seems to have an invisible tag}yeah.

\S2{sub-sub} Smaller heading still

A tiny section. Awww. How cute.

\A{app} Needless appendix

Here's an \i{appendix}, for no terribly good reason at all. See
\k{book}.

It also contains a \W{http://www.gallery.uk.eu.org/}{hyperlink}.

\U Bibliography

\B{book} Some text describing a book.

\B{nocite} Some text describing a book. This text should appear in
the document even though there is no \cw{\\k} citing it.

\BR{book} [SillyCitation]

\nocite{nocite}

\B{uncited} If this text appears, there's an actual error.

\# This is a comment.

\# Now for the index section.

\IM{she seems to have an invisible tag}{appendix} Invisible tags
and/or appendices
