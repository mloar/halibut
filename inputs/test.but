\title Halibut: A Test Document With A Stupidly Long Title Just To
See If Wrapping Titles Works OK. In Fact This Title Will Span Three
Lines, Not Just Two. How's That For Ludicrous?

This paragraph is not labelled \q{preamble}, but should still appear
as it.

\preamble This manual is a small joke effort, designed to use every
feature \#{ comment } that Halibut's input format supports. Creation
date \date{%Y.%m.%d} (default format is \date).

\c Here is a code paragraph in the preamble, just to stress that all
\c things are possible. Ooh!

Here's another paragraph, which goes after the copyright.

multi-line macro, talking about \coopt
a bit]

\C{ch\\ap} First chapter title; for similar wrapping reasons this
chapter title will be ludicrously long. I wonder how much more
chapter title I can write before feeling silly.

This is a para\#{another{} comment}graph of text. It
has line\#{yet another one} breaks in   between words, multiple
  spaces (ignored), and \e{emphasised text} as well as \c{code
fragments}.

\cw{This} is weak code. And \k{head} contains some other stuff.
\K{subhead} does too.

To test the man page back end:

.Directive

'Directive

\\Sping\\Spong\\Spoing

\H{head} First section title (very long again, no prizes for
guessing the reason why this time, and here's yet more text to pad
it out to three lines of output)

\cfg{winhelp-topic}{M359HPEHGW}

Here's a code paragraph:

\c No leading spaces
\c  One leading space
\c Two blank lines follow this one.
\c
\c
\c Two blank lines precede this one.
\c   Two leading spaces
\c We can use \ { and } with impunity here.
\c We can use discretionary bold and italic in code paragraphs!
\e                          bbbb     iiiiii
\c Isn't that ludicrous?

This is a list:

\b Ooh.

\b Aah.

\lcont{

This bulletted list contains a list continuation. This is an
additional paragraph, or more than one, indented at the same level
as the list items, and able to contain nested sublists and other
features. For example, here's a code paragraph:

\c spingle:~$ whoami
\c spoggler

And here's a sublist. Numbered, just for variety.

\n One.

\lcont{

\n 1a.

\n 1b.

\lcont{
\c Code
\c Paragraph
}

\n 1c.

\lcont{This is an even sillier one: a continuation of a list item in
a continuation of a list item in a continuation of a list item!}

}

\n Two.

\n Threeeee!

}

\b Eek.

This is a horizontal rule:

\rule

This is a numbered list:

\n Ooh.

\n{keyword} Aah.

\n Eek. \q{Aah} is point \k{keyword}.

This is a description list:

\dt FISH

\dd A piscine creature, often to be found swimming aimlessly around
in the sea eating things and not contributing to the global economy.

\lcont{

Here's another of those funky list continuation things, just to keep
Halibut on its toes.

}

\dt BADGER

\dd A non-piscine creature, often to be found snuffling around on
land, not contributing to the global economy, and not even swimming
to make up for it. I don't know. These mammals. Pa-thetic.

\dt "SAUSAGE SALESMAN"

\dd An exemplary contributor to the global economy. Unless he's CMOT
Dibbler.

Use of macros: let's talk about \coopt. And about \coopt some more.
And a nested macro: \metacoopt.

A slightly more difficult macro: \eur\.2500.

Test of input character set switching.

\n 8859 character in ASCII mode: expect nothing useful. [coöpt]

\cfg{input-charset}{ISO-8859-1}

\n 8859 character in 8859 mode: expect the right thing. [coöpt]

\cfg{input-charset}{UTF-8}

\n 8859 character in UTF-8 mode: expect the wrong thing. [coöpt]

\cfg{silliness}{coÃ¶pt}

\n UTF-8 sequence in UTF-8 mode: expect the right thing again. [coÃ¶pt]

\cfg{input-charset}{ASCII}

Back to ASCII again.

Oh, while I'm here: some special characters. The \\, \{ and \}
characters, to be precise. And their code equivalents, \c{\\},
\i\c{\{}, \c{\}}.

\S{subhead} First subheading

So here's a \I{subheading}\I{subsection}subsection. Just
incidentally, \q{this} is in quotes. \ii{Those} quotes had better work
in all formats.

We'll try for some Unicode here: \i{Schr\u00F6{oe}dinger}.

An index tag containing non-alternatived Unicode: \i{\u00BFChe?}

An invisible index tag: \I{she seems to have an invisible tag}yeah.

\S2{sub-sub}{Florble} Smaller heading still

A tiny section. Awww. How cute. Actually, this one's a \e{florble},
and here's a reference to it: \k{sub-sub}.

\A{app} Needless appendix

\# \cfg{winhelp-topic}{Y5VQEXZQVJ} (uncomment this and it clashes)

Here's an \i{appendix}, for no terribly good reason at all. See
__\k{book}__ (please excuse those underscores, I'm testing
whitespace).

It also contains a \W{http://www.tartarus.org/}{hyperlink}.

Here are some subsections with silly chapter titles and interesting
use of Unicode. The Unicode oddities are in the titles rather than
the body text because that way I get to test their handling in the
PDF document outline.

\H{app-one} The 1024 \u00D7{x} 768 screen resolution

Err.

\H{app-two} How about Spongletech\u2122{(TM)}?

Umm.

\H{app-three} Or just Erd\u0151{\u00F6{o}}s?

Ahh.

\U Bibliography

\B{book} Some text describing a book.

\B{nocite} Some text describing a book. This text should appear in
the document even though there is no \cw{\\k} citing it.

\BR{book} [SillyCitation]
\BR{uncited} Badger.

\nocite{nocite}

\B{uncited} If this text appears, there's an actual error.

\# This is a comment.

\# Now for the index section.

\IM{she seems to have an invisible tag}{appendix} Invisible tags
and/or appendices
