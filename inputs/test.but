\title Halibut: A Test Document With A Stupidly Long Title Just To
See If Wrapping Titles Works OK. In Fact This Title Will Span Three
Lines, Not Just Two. How's That For Ludicrous?

\C{ch\\ap} First chapter title; for similar wrapping reasons this
chapter title will be ludicrously long. I wonder how much more
chapter title I can write before feeling silly.

This is a para\#{another{} comment}graph of text. It
has line\#{yet another one} breaks in   between words, multiple
  spaces (ignored), and \e{emphasised text} as well as \c{code
fragments}.

\cw{This} is weak code. And \k{head} contains some other stuff.
\K{subhead} does too.

\H{head} First section title (very long again, no prizes for
guessing the reason why this time, and here's yet more text to pad
it out to three lines of output)

\cfg{winhelp-topic}{M359HPEHGW}

Here's a code paragraph:

\c No leading spaces
\c  One leading space
\c Two blank lines follow this one.
\c
\c
\c Two blank lines precede this one.
\c   Two leading spaces
\c We can use \ { and } with impunity here.

This is a list:

\b Ooh.

\b Aah.

\b Eek.

This is a horizontal rule:

\rule

This is a numbered list:

\n Ooh.

\n{keyword} Aah.

\n Eek. \q{Aah} is point \k{keyword}.

A-paragraph-full-of-hyphens-to-test-the-idea-that-word-wrapping-can-happen-somewhere-in-all-this-hyphenatory-nonsense.

A\-paragraph\-full\-of\-nonbreaking\-hyphens\-to\-test\-the\-idea\-that\-word\-wrapping\-misses\-them.

A\_paragraph\_full\_of\_nonbreaking\_spaces\_to\_test\_the\_idea\_that\_word\_wrapping\_misses\_them\_too.

Use of macros: let's talk about \coopt. And about \coopt some more.
And a nested macro: \metacoopt.

Oh, while I'm here: some special characters. The \\, \{ and \}
characters, to be precise. And their code equivalents, \c{\\},
\i\c{\{}, \c{\}}.

\S{subhead} First subheading

So here's a \I{subheading}\I{subsection}subsection. Just
incidentally, \q{this} is in quotes. \ii{Those} quotes had better work
in all formats.

We'll try for some Unicode here: \i{Schr\u00F6{oe}dinger}.

An index tag containing non-alternatived Unicode: \i{\u00BFChe?}

An invisible index tag: \I{she seems to have an invisible tag}yeah.

\S2{sub-sub}{Florble} Smaller heading still

A tiny section. Awww. How cute. Actually, this one's a \e{florble},
and here's a reference to it: \k{sub-sub}.

\A{app} Needless appendix

\# \cfg{winhelp-topic}{Y5VQEXZQVJ} (uncomment this and it clashes)

Here's an \i{appendix}, for no terribly good reason at all. See
__\k{book}__ (please excuse those underscores, I'm testing
whitespace).

It also contains a \W{http://www.tartarus.org/}{hyperlink}.

\U Bibliography

\B{book} Some text describing a book.

\B{nocite} Some text describing a book. This text should appear in
the document even though there is no \cw{\\k} citing it.

\BR{book} [SillyCitation]
\BR{uncited} Badger.

\nocite{nocite}

\B{uncited} If this text appears, there's an actual error.

\# This is a comment.

\# Now for the index section.

\IM{she seems to have an invisible tag}{appendix} Invisible tags
and/or appendices
