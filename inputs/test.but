\title Halibut: A Test Document With A Stupidly Long Title (worth \eur\.1000)
Just To See If Wrapping Titles Works OK. In Fact This Title Will Span Three
Lines, Not Just Two. How's That For Ludicrous?  More than that, though,
we'd like to make it more than 255 characters long so that the PostScript
backend has to treat it specially in order to pass it to pdfmark.

This paragraph is not labelled \q{preamble}, but should still appear
as it.

\preamble This manual is a small joke effort, designed to use every
feature \#{ comment } that Halibut's input format supports. Creation
date \date{%Y.%m.%d} (default format is \date).

\c Here is a code paragraph in the preamble, just to stress that all
\c things are possible. Ooh!

\C{ch\\ap} First chapter title; for similar wrapping reasons this
chapter title will be ludicrously long. I wonder how much more
chapter title I can write before feeling silly.

This is a para\#{another{} comment}graph of text. It
has line\#{yet another one} breaks in   between words, multiple
  spaces (ignored), and \e{emphasised text} as well as \c{code
fragments}.

\#{This is an inline comment alone in a paragraph.}

\cw{This} is weak code; \cq{this} is quoted code. And \k{head}
contains some other stuff. \K{subhead} does too.

To test the man page back end:

\H{head} First section title (very long again, no prizes for
guessing the reason why this time, and here's yet more text to pad
it out to three lines of output)

\cfg{winhelp-topic}{M359HPEHGW}

Here's a code paragraph:

\c No leading spaces
\c  One leading space
\c Two blank lines follow this one.

\c Two blank lines precede this one.
\c   Two leading spaces
\c We can use \ { and } with impunity here.
\c We can use discretionary bold and italic in code paragraphs!

\c Isn't that ludicrous?
\c 
\c man page tricky characters: command -o 'quoted' -o `backticks`

This is a list:

\b Ooh.

\b Aah.

\lcont{

This bulletted list contains a list continuation. This is an
additional paragraph, or more than one, indented at the same level
as the list items, and able to contain nested sublists and other
features. For example, here's a code paragraph:

\c spingle:~$ whoami
\c spoggler

And here's a sublist. Numbered, just for variety.

\n One.

\lcont{

\n 1a.

\n 1b.

\lcont{
\c Code
\c Paragraph
}

\n 1c.

\lcont{This is an even sillier one: a continuation of a list item in
a continuation of a list item in a continuation of a list item!}

}

\n Two.

\n Threeeee!

}

\b Eek.

This is a horizontal rule:

\rule

This is a numbered list:

\n Ooh.

\n{keyword} Aah.

\n Eek. \q{Aah} is point \k{keyword}.

This is a description list:

\dt FISH

\dd A piscine creature, often to be found swimming aimlessly around
in the sea eating things and not contributing to the global economy.

\lcont{

Here's another of those funky list continuation things, just to keep
Halibut on its toes.

}

\dt BADGER

\dd A non-piscine creature, often to be found snuffling around on
land, not contributing to the global economy, and not even swimming
to make up for it. I don't know. These mammals. Pa-thetic.

\dt "SAUSAGE SALESMAN"

\dd An exemplary contributor to the global economy. Unless he's CMOT
Dibbler.

This is a much more interesting description list, testing
consecutive \c{\\dt}s and consecutive \c{\\dd}s:

\dt One

\dt Two

\dt Three

\dd Ay

\dt Four

\dd Bee

\dd Cee

Test of input character set switching.

Back to ASCII again.

Oh, while I'm here: some special characters. The \\, \{ and \}
characters, to be precise. And their code equivalents, \c{\\},
\i\c{\{}, \c{\}}.  The ` and ' characters (grave and apostrophe)
are special in some output formats.

Now let's exercise the paper backends a little.  This is the entire
Adobe Standard Latin character set, which should be enough to cause
us to need to encode the main font twice:

Testing ligatures in normal (fi), empasised (\e{fi}), code (\c{fi}) and
weak code (\cw{fi}).  The latter two should not be ligated.

\c Also in a code paragraph (fi) with bold (fi) and italic (fi).
\e                                          bb              ii
\c There should be no ligation there.

The following pair of characters map to different glyphs with the same name in
some Microsoft TrueType fonts: \u0394{(missing)} \u2206{(missing)}

\S{subhead} First subheading

So here's a \I{subheading}\I{subsection}subsection. Just
incidentally, \q{this} is in quotes. \ii{Those} quotes had better work
in all formats.

We'll try for some Unicode here: \i{Schr\u00F6{oe}dinger}.

An index tag containing non-alternatived Unicode: \i{\u00BFChe?}

An invisible index tag: \I{she seems to have an invisible tag}yeah.

An index tag inside another tag: jackdaws love my \e{big \i{sphinx}}
of quartz.

Similarly, we should support things like hyperlinks
\e{\W{http://www.tartarus.org/}{at the beginning} of emphasised sections},
and \e{in the \W{http://www.tartarus.org/}{middle} of them}, and also
\e{at the \W{http://home.att.net/~cecw/lastpage.htm}{end}}.

\#{FIXME: Unfortunately, we still don't quite do the right thing with
references:
How about a \e{reference to \k{subhead} here}? And at
\e{the end: \k{subhead}} and \e{\k{subhead}: the start}?
}

\S2{sub-sub}{Florble} Smaller heading still

A tiny section. Awww. How cute. Actually, this one's a \e{florble},
and here's a reference to it: \k{sub-sub}.

\A{app} Needless appendix

\# \cfg{winhelp-topic}{Y5VQEXZQVJ} (uncomment this and it clashes)

Here's an \i{appendix}, for no terribly good reason at all. See
__\k{book}__ (please excuse those underscores, I'm testing
whitespace).

It also contains a \W{http://www.tartarus.org/}{hyperlink}.

Also I'm going to index \i\c{-output} to ensure that its two
components are displayed as a joined-up code fragment in the index.

Here are \I{testone}some \I{testtwo}subsections \I{testthree}with
silly chapter titles and interesting use of Unicode. The Unicode
oddities are in the titles rather than the body text because that
way I get to test their handling in the PDF document outline.

\H{app-one} The 1024 \u00D7{x} 768 screen resolution

Err.

\H{app-two} How about Spongletech\u2122{(TM)}?

Umm.

\# I'm going to label one of these with a carefully chosen fragment
\# name "i1", because I know this will also be generated as an index
\# fragment name and this allows me to test the fragment name clash
\# detection.
\#
\# To actually run this test you need to configure html-leaf-level
\# to 0 and html-template-fragment to %k.

\H{i1} Or just Erd\u0151{\u00F6{o}}s?

Ahh.

\H{app-\\two} Section with inconvenient keyword

If you apply this file together with \cw{doc/chm.but}, this section
should test \cw{html_sanitise_filename()}.

\U Bibliography

\B{book} Some text describing a book.

\B{nocite} Some text describing a book. This text should appear in
the document even though there is no \cw{\\k} citing it.

\BR{book} [SillyCitation]
\BR{uncited} Badger.

\nocite{nocite}

\B{uncited} If this text appears, there's an actual error.

\# This is a comment.

\# Now for the index section.

\IM{she seems to have an invisible tag}{appendix} Invisible tags
and/or appendices

\# The display forms of these three index terms differ only in case.
\# This is a fiddly special case in the Windows Help backend,
\# because Windows Help's index mechanism is case-insensitive...
