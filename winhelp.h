 * 
 * If you want to specify a particular context string (for
 * reference from other programs, to provide context-sensitive
 * help), you can supply it here. Otherwise, just pass NULL and a
 * nondescript one will be allocated automatically.
 *
 * If you specify two context strings which clash under the Windows
 * help file hash algorithm, this function will return NULL and
 * provide a pointer to the other context string that this one
 * clashed with, and you must tell your user to fix the clash.
 * Sadly this is the only way to do it; despite HLP files having a
 * perfectly good method of mapping arbitrary strings to things,
 * they didn't see fit to use that method for help contexts, so
 * instead they hash the context names and expect the hashes to be
 * unique. Sigh.
 * 
 * On success (i.e. in any circumstance other than a hash clash), a
 * valid WHLP_TOPIC is returned for later use.
